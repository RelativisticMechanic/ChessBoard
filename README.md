# Chess Board

This is a simple (as of now) Chess Board application written in C++ and uses Javidx9's olcPixelGameEngine for the output. You'll need Visual Studio 2022 to run the project. I've not tested it on Linux or any other platform except Windows 11.

## Features

- 360x120 PNG spritesheets for pieces
- Can parse FENs
- Move stack (can move forward and backward)

## Planned Features

- Check move validity
- Be able to pair it up with an engine like StockFish
- Eventually, I'll use it as a frontend for my own chess engine I've been planning to work on.

I've tried to keep the code as clean as possible and easy to read. Have fun hacking!

Regards,
S. Gautam.
